  title: Complex systems
  content: |-
    The most famous quote about Complex Systems comes from Aristotle who said that "The whole is more than the sum of its parts".
    Complex systems are systems where the collective behavior of their parts entails emergence of properties that can hardly, if not at all, be inferred from properties of the parts. Examples of complex systems include ant-hills, ants themselves, human economies, climate, nervous systems, cells and living things, including human beings, as well as modern energy or telecommunication infrastructures.
