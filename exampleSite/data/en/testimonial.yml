    content: 'The study of complex adaptive systems from the natural world, systems
      such as swarms of bees, flocks of birds or herds of animals, has illuminated
      how the group as a whole and its members are influenced by, and influence, each
      other. Pursuing questions such as ‘How do birds flock?’ and ‘How do bees swarm?’
      has led scientists to investigate how individual elements act within the context
      of the whole. '
